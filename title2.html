    <h2><a name="act1">Act I</a></h2>
    <p>Romeo and Juliet begins as the Chorus introduces two feuding families of Verona: the Capulets and the 
       Montagues. On a hot summer's day, the young men of each faction fight until the Prince of Verona 
       intercedes and threatens to banish them. Soon after, the head of the Capulet family plans a feast. 
       His goal is to introduce his daughter Juliet to a Count named Paris who seeks to marry Juliet. 
       Montague's son Romeo and his friends (Benvolio and Mercutio) hear of the party and resolve to go in 
       disguise. Romeo hopes to see his beloved Rosaline at the party. Instead, while there, he meets Juliet 
       and falls instantly in love with her. Juliet's cousin Tybalt recognises the Montague boys and forces 
       them to leave just as Romeo and Juliet discover one another. </p>
    <h2><a name="act2">Act II</a></h2>
    <p>Romeo lingers near the Capulet house to talk with Juliet when she appears in her window. The pair 
       declare their love for one another and intend to marry the next day. With the help of Juliet's Nurse, 
       the lovers arrange to marry when Juliet goes for confession at the cell of Friar Laurence. There, 
       they are secretly married (talk about a short engagement). </p>
    <h2><a name="act3">Act III</a></h2>
    <p>Following the secret marriage, Juliet's cousin Tybalt sends a challenge to Romeo. Romeo refuses to 
       fight, which angers his friend Mercutio who then fights with Tybalt. Mercutio is accidentally killed as 
       Romeo intervenes to stop the fight. In anger, Romeo pursues Tybalt, kills him, and is banished by the 
       Prince. 
       Juliet is anxious when Romeo is late to meet her and learns of the brawl, Tybalt's death, and Romeo's 
       banishment. Friar Laurence arranges for Romeo to spend the night with Juliet before he leaves for 
       Mantua. Meanwhile, the Capulet family grieves for Tybalt, so Lord Capulet moves Juliet's marriage to 
       Paris to the next day. Julietâ€™s parents are angry when Juliet doesn't want to marry Paris, but they 
       don't know about her secret marriage to Romeo.  </p>
    <h2><a name="act4">Act IV</a></h2>
    <p>Friar Laurence helps Juliet by providing a sleeping draught that will make her seem dead. When the 
       wedding party arrives to greet Juliet the next day, they believe she is dead. The Friar sends a 
       messenger to warn Romeo of Juliet's plan and bids him to come to the Capulet family monument to 
       rescue his sleeping wife. </p>
    <h2><a name="act5">Act V</a></h2>
    <p>The vital message to Romeo doesn't arrive in time because the plague is in town (so the messenger 
       cannot leave Verona). Hearing from his servant that Juliet is dead, Romeo buys poison from an 
       Apothecary in Mantua. He returns to Verona and goes to the tomb where he surprises and kills the 
       mourning Paris. Romeo takes his poison and dies, while Juliet awakens from her drugged coma. She learns 
       what has happened from Friar Laurence, but she refuses to leave the tomb and stabs herself. The Friar 
       returns with the Prince, the Capulets, and Romeo's lately widowed father. The deaths of their children 
       lead the families to make peace, and they promise to erect a monument in Romeo and Juliet's memory.</p>
