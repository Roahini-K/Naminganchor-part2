    <h2><a name="act1">Act I</a></h2>
    <p>In Venice, a merchant named Antonio worries that his ships are overdue. As his colleagues offer 
       comfort, his young friends—Bassanio, Graziano, and Lorenzo—arrive. Bassanio asks Antonio for a loan, 
       so that he can pursue the wealthy Portia, who lives in Belmont. Antonio cannot afford the loan. Instead, 
       he sends Bassanio to borrow the money on the security of Antonio's expected shipments.</p>
    <h2><a name="act2">Act II</a></h2>
    <p>Meanwhile, one of Shylock's servants, Launcelot, wishes to change masters and persuades Bassanio to 
       employ him. Shylock's daughter, Jessica, also longs to leave home. She wants to become a Christian and 
       marry Antonio's friend Lorenzo. Before he departs to serve his new master, Launcelot takes a letter to 
       Lorenzo that contains plans for Lorenzo and Jessica to elope that night. When Shylock goes out, Jessica 
       escapes to elope, taking gold and jewels with her. The following day, Bassanio sets sail for Belmont, 
       while Shylock rages over the loss of his daughter and the treasures she has stolen.
       In Belmont, one of Portia’s suitors (the Prince of Morocco) chooses the golden casket, while another 
       (the Prince of Aragon) selects silver. Both chose the wrong casket and are unsuccessful. As Aragon leaves, 
       Bassanio is announced. Portia eagerly goes to greet him.  </p>
    <h2><a name="act3">Act III</a></h2>
    <p>After a few days, Shylock hears that his daughter Jessica is squandering her stolen wealth in Genoa. 
       He begins to rail bitterly against Christians. He reminds Antonio's friends that if the loan is not 
       repaid on time, he will insist on the original agreement of one pound of flesh.Back in Belmont, 
       Bassanio chooses the lead casket, and in so doing, he wins Portia. His friend Graziano asks for Portia's 
       maid Nerissa to be his wife. Portia gives her ring to Bassanio, making him promise never to give it to 
       another. As Lorenzo and Jessica come to Belmont, news arrives that Antonio's ships have been lost at sea, 
       and he is now bankrupt. They are also told Shylock insists on the fulfilment of his bond and has had 
       Antonio arrested. Bassanio and Graziano leave in haste to help Antonio. Portia and Nerissa resolve to 
       follow afterwards, disguised as lawyers.  </p>
    <h2><a name="act4">Act IV</a></h2>
    <p>In the court in Venice, Shylock demands his pound of flesh. The Duke, presiding over the court, seeks legal advice 
       from the lawyer "Balthazar," who is Portia in disguise. Portia pleads for Shylock to have mercy on 
       Antonio. Bassanio offers his wife's money, which would more than pay the debt, but Shylock refuses to 
       accept. Antonio's death is only prevented as Balthazar explains the bond is for flesh but not for a 
       single drop of blood. So Shylock cannot collect the pound of flesh. </p>
    <h2><a name="act5">Act V</a></h2>
    <p>Undisguised, Portia and Nerissa return home at night to find Lorenzo and Jessica enjoying the tranquillity 
       of Belmont. When their husbands arrive, Portia and Nerissa scold them for giving away their rings, 
       pretending they had been given away to other women. Before long, they reveal themselves as the lawyers 
       from the trial. Antonio receives news that his ships have returned safely after all (looks like we didn't 
       need to go through all this mess in the first place!). The play ends as the three couples prepare to 
       celebrate their marriages.</p>
