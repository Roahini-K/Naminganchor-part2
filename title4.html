    <h2><a name="act1">Act I</a></h2>
    <p>Orlando, the youngest son of the recently-deceased Sir Roland de Boys, 
       is treated harshly by his eldest brother, Oliver. Bitter and angry, Orlando challenges the court 
       wrestler, Charles, to a fight. When Oliver learns of the fight, Oliver tells Charles to injure 
       Orlando if possible.Duke Frederick has recently deposed his brother, Duke Senior, as head of the court. 
       But he allowed Senior's daughter, Rosalind, to remain, and she and Celia, the new Duke's daughter, watch 
       the wrestling competition. During the match, Rosalind falls in love with Orlando, who beats Charles. 
       Rosalind gives Orlando a chain to wear; in turn, he is overcome with love.  </p>
    <h2><a name="act2">Act II</a></h2>
    <p>Shortly after, Orlando is warned of his brother's plot against him and seeks refuge in the Forest of 
       Arden. At the same time, and seemingly without cause, Duke Frederick banishes Rosalind. She decides to 
       seek shelter in the Forest of Arden with Celia. They both disguise themselves: Rosalind as the young man 
       Ganymede and Celia as his shepherdess sister Aliena. Touchstone, the court fool, also goes with them. </p>
    <h2><a name="act3">Act III</a></h2>
    <p>In the Forest of Arden, the weary cousins happen upon Silvius, a lovesick shepherd. Silvius was in the 
       act of declaring his feelings for Phoebe, a scornful shepherdess. Ganymede buys the lease to the property 
       of an old shepherd who needs someone to manage his estate. Ganymede and Aliena set up home in the forest. 
       Not far away, and unaware of the newcomers, Duke Senior is living a simple outdoor life with his fellow 
       exiled courtiers and huntsmen. Their merriment is interrupted by the arrival of Orlando, who seeks 
       nourishment for himself and his servant. The two men are welcomed by the outlaw courtiers.Ganymede and 
       Aliena find verses addressed to Rosalind hung on the forest branches by Orlando. Ganymede finds Orlando 
       and proposes to cure Orlando of his love. To do this, Orlando will woo Ganymede as if he were Rosalind 
       (even though "he" really is . . . Rosalind). Orlando consents and visits Ganymede/Rosalind every day for 
       his lessons. In the meantime, the shepherdess Phoebe has fallen for Ganymede while the shepherd Silvius 
       still pursues her.  Furthermore, Touchstone, the court fool, has dazzled a country girl, Audrey, with his 
       courtly manners. Audrey deserts her young suitor, William, for him.</p>
    <h2><a name="act4">Act IV</a></h2>
    <p>When Duke Frederick hears Orlando disappeared at the same time as Rosalind and Celia, he orders Oliver 
       to the forest to seek his brother. In the forest, Orlando saves Oliver's life, injuring his arm in the 
       process. Oliver runs into Ganymede and Aliena in the forest and relates this news. Rosalind (disguised 
       as Ganymede) is overcome with her feelings for Orlando. Celia (disguised as Aliena) and Oliver quickly 
       fall in love with one another. Rosalind decides that it is time to end her game with Orlando and devises 
       a plan in which everyone will get married.</p>
    <h2><a name="act5">Act V</a></h2>
    <p>As Ganymede, Rosalind promises Phoebe that they will marry, Celia will marry Oliver, Touchstone will 
       marry Audrey, and Orlando will marry Rosalind. She makes Phoebe promise that if they, for some reason, 
       don't get married, Phoebe will marry Silvius instead. 
       On the day of the wedding, and with the help of the god Hymen, Rosalind reappears in her female clothes. 
       Duke Senior gives her away to Orlando, while Phoebe accepts Silvius. Orlando's other older brother returns 
       from college with the news that Celia's father, Duke Ferdinand, has left court to become a hermit. Thus, 
       everyone is happy (except maybe Phoebe, who marries someone she doesn't love and Silvius, who marries 
       someone who doesn't love him). The play ends with a joyful dance to celebrate the four marriages.</p>
