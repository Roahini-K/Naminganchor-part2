    <h2><a name="act1">Act I</a></h2>
    <p>On a bleak Scottish moorland, Macbeth and Banquo, two of King Duncan's generals, discover three strange 
       women (witches). The witches prophesy that Macbeth will be promoted twice: to Thane of Cawdor (a rank of 
       the aristocracy bestowed by grateful kings) and King of Scotland. Banquo's descendants will be kings, but 
       Banquo isn't promised any kingdom himself. The generals want to hear more, but the "weird sisters" 
       disappear. Soon afterwards, King Duncan names Macbeth Thane of Cawdor as a reward for his success in 
       the recent battles. The promotion seems to support the prophecy. The King then proposes to make a brief 
       visit that night to Macbeth's castle at Inverness. Lady Macbeth receives news from her husband about the 
       prophecy and his new title. She vows to help him become king by whatever means are necessary (*ominous 
       music*). </p>
    <h2><a name="act2">Act II</a></h2>
    <p>Macbeth returns to his castle, followed almost immediately by King Duncan. The Macbeths plot together 
       to kill Duncan and wait until everyone is asleep. At the appointed time, Lady Macbeth gives the guards 
       drugged wine so Macbeth can enter and kill the King. He regrets this almost immediately, but his wife 
       reassures him. She leaves the bloody daggers by the dead king just before Macduff, a nobleman, arrives. 
       When Macduff discovers the murder, Macbeth kills the drunken guards in a show of rage and retribution. 
       Duncan's sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, flee, fearing for their own lives; but they are, nevertheless, 
       blamed for the murder. </p>
    <h2><a name="act3">Act III</a></h2>
    <p>Macbeth becomes King of Scotland but is plagued by feelings of insecurity. He remembers the prophecy 
       that Banquo's descendants will inherit the throne and arranges for Banquo and his son Fleance to be 
       killed. In the darkness, Banquo is murdered, but his son escapes the assassins. At his state banquet 
       that night, Macbeth sees the ghost of Banquo and worries the courtiers with his mad response. Lady 
       Macbeth dismisses the court and unsuccessfully tries to calm her husband. </p>
    <h2><a name="act4">Act IV</a></h2>
    <p>Macbeth seeks out the witches who say that he will be safe until a local wood, Birnam Wood, marches 
       into battle against him. He also need not fear anyone born of woman (that sounds secure, no loop-holes 
       here). They also prophesy that the Scottish succession will still come from Banquo's son. Macbeth 
       embarks on a reign of terror, slaughtering many, including Macduff's family. Macduff had gone to seek 
       Malcolm (one of Duncan's sons who fled) at the court of the English king. Malcolm is young and unsure 
       of himself, but Macduff, pained with grief, persuades him to lead an army against Macbeth. </p>
    <h2><a name="act5">Act V</a></h2>
    <p>Macbeth feels safe in his remote castle at Dunsinane until he is told that Birnam Wood is moving towards him. 
       Malcolm's army is carrying branches from the forest as camouflage for their assault on Macbeth's 
       stronghold. Meanwhile, an overwrought and conscience-ridden Lady Macbeth walks in her sleep and tells 
       her secrets to her doctor. She commits suicide. As the final battle commences, Macbeth hears of Lady 
       Macbeth's suicide and mourns.In the midst of a losing battle, Macduff challenges Macbeth. Macbeth 
       learns Macduff is the child of a caesarean birth (loophole!), realises he is doomed, and submits to 
       his enemy. Macduff triumphs and brings the head of the traitor Macbeth to Malcolm. Malcolm declares 
       peace and goes to Scone to be crowned king. </p>
